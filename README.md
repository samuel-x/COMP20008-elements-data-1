# Data Analysis 
This was the first assignment for COMP20008 Elements of Data Processing. 
In it we learnt the basics of using Jupyter Notebook as well as Data Scraping, Processing and Analysis.

It was cool to be able to spin the analysis any way you wanted. 
This was expanded upon in [part 2](https://github.com/samuel-x/elements-data-2).
